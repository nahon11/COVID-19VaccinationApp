# COVID-19VaccinationApp
This application is a project written in JAVA to help with managing the COVID-19 vaccination system in Quebec.

The application is based off of the ER model found in ER.pdf, and the relational modal detailed in realtional.pdf.

The file VaccineApp.java interacts with the user that wants to execute certain actions, such as booking a vaccine slot in the database, while executing queries in the database to see if the requested action is possible or not.
